# Martinez_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final project for CSCI 2270

Project Summary
  
  This program creates a database using strings. When the program is started up, it takes the info from a text document and converts it into a hash table. Information can then be added, deleted, or looked up by the user. When the program is terminated, the information on the hash table is once again converted into a text document. This allows information to be stored while the program is not running. Each place in the hash table will have a category. Within that category, there will be items related to that category. For example, if one of the categories was cars, one of the items in that category might be a Volvo. This flexible system allows the user to make a database of whatever they want, provided that each item only has a category and a description/name.
